## üì¶ Installation

This package is part of the Lead Ignite backend and is automatically installed as a dependency.

For development:

```bash
# Install with poetry
poetry add --group dev -e ./app/core/third_party_integrations/postgrid
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration is managed through environment variables. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
# Required
POSTGRID_API_KEY=your_live_or_test_api_key

# Optional (with defaults shown)
POSTGRID_BASE_URL=https://api.postgrid.com/print-mail/v1/
POSTGRID_TIMEOUT=30
POSTGRID_MAX_RETRIES=3
POSTGRID_RATE_LIMIT=50  # Requests per minute
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Initialization

```python
import asyncio
from app.core.third_party_integrations.postgrid.client import PostGridClient

async def main():
    # Initialize with default config (loads from environment)
    async with PostGridClient() as client:
        try:
            # Your code here
            pass
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Example: Sending a Postcard

```python
async def send_postcard():
    async with PostGridClient() as client:
        try:
            postcard = await client.post(
                "/postcards",
                json={
                    "to": {
                        "firstName": "John",
                        "lastName": "Doe",
                        "addressLine1": "123 Main St",
                        "city": "Toronto",
                        "provinceOrState": "ON",
                        "postalOrZip": "M1M1M1",
                        "country": "CA"
                    },
                    "from": {
                        "company": "Your Company",
                        "addressLine1": "456 Business Ave",
                        "city": "New York",
                        "provinceOrState": "NY",
                        "postalOrZip": "10001",
                        "country": "US"
                    },
                    "front": "<html>Front HTML</html>",
                    "back": "<html>Back HTML</html>"
                }
            )
            return postcard
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to send postcard: {e}")
            raise
```

## üìö API Reference

### Client Methods

#### `PostGridClient`

Main client class for interacting with the PostGrid API.

**Methods:**

- `get(endpoint: str, response_model: Type[T] = None, **kwargs) -> Any`
  - Make a GET request to the specified endpoint
  - Returns: Parsed response data

- `post(endpoint: str, response_model: Type[T] = None, **kwargs) -> Any`
  - Make a POST request to the specified endpoint
  - Returns: Parsed response data

- `put(endpoint: str, response_model: Type[T] = None, **kwargs) -> Any`
  - Make a PUT request to the specified endpoint
  - Returns: Parsed response data

- `delete(endpoint: str, **kwargs) -> Any`
  - Make a DELETE request to the specified endpoint
  - Returns: Parsed response data

### Available Endpoints

The client supports all PostGrid API endpoints, organized into logical modules:

- `letters/` - Create and manage physical letters
- `postcards/` - Design and send postcards
- `contacts/` - Manage contact information
- `templates/` - Store and manage reusable templates
- `webhooks/` - Configure and manage webhook events
- `trackers/` - Track mail pieces and events
- `events/` - Retrieve system and mail events

## üîÑ Error Handling

The client raises specific exceptions for different error scenarios:

- `PostGridAuthenticationError`: Invalid or missing API key (401)
- `PostGridValidationError`: Invalid request data (400)
- `PostGridRateLimitError`: Rate limit exceeded (429)
- `PostGridAPIError`: Other API errors (500+)

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite with pytest:

```bash
pytest app/core/third_party_integrations/postgrid/tests/
```

### Test Configuration

Tests use a mock server by default. To run against the live API:

```bash
POSTGRID_API_KEY=your_test_key POSTGRID_ENV=test pytest -v
```

## üõ† Development

### Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Document all public methods with Google-style docstrings
- Keep functions small and focused

### Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
